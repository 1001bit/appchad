comment / chat message reply
message / comment linking

Notification via websocket:
- User A likes User B's article and article gets upvote
- server gets that and makes a notification:
{
    RecID
    SenderID
    Action(Enum: "vote, comment-reply, chat-reply, comment")
    id (comment, article, chat message)
}
- If user B is online: send notification to him
- If user B is offline: add notification to database and delete it after reading
- Save the message on user's local storage
- Clicking on notification will redirect to comment, article etc.

Plan:
- Make chat essentials
- make notifications
